            <p>PHP, a server-side language that has been around for more than 25 years, 
                tends to evoke some strong opinions among developers today. 
                Whenever a new programming language or tool emerges, you’ll probably find a 
                discussion over where PHP is ‘dead’. It is true that PHP has slipped down 
                the rankings of the most popular programming languages, from 5th in 2017 to 
                8th in 2020 as per the Stack Overflow annual developer survey. And yet, 
                PHP continues to be used by nearly 80% of all websites, powering some major 
                platforms like Wordpress and Facebook.</p>
